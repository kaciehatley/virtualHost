# Virtual Host

Virtual Host is an application that takes an event and transforms it into an educative experience.  Based on your proximity, a host can convey information via notifications to a logged-in user. Perhaps you want to give a virtual tour of a large-scale facility. Or you could be a vendor at an expo using this application as a virtual business card. Maybe youâ€™re even a recent grad at a demo day wanting recruiters to have quick links to your portfolio and resume. Using innovative technologies such as Beacon, Virtual Host can do all of this and more!
